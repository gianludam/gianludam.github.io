On this page, I will upload some products of my research. There are my three dissertations (B.A., M.A., and especially Ph.D.). Other material hopefully will arrive...

## My Bachelor's dissertation

I obtained my Bachelor's in History with a dissertation on Pietro Verri, an enlightenment Milanese intellectual. In 1771 Verri published a brief work about Political Economy, titled «Le Meditazioni sull'Economia Politica». In my dissertation, I analyzed the content of this work, also embedding it in the development of European Economic Thought in the XVIIIth century. This work is in Italian, but if you are interested (and understand Italian), you can read it [here](/files/TesiTriennale2016.pdf).

## My Master of Arts dissertation

I earned my Master of Arts in History and Civilization at the University of Pisa. There I worked mainly on the political theory of the renowned economist (and Economics Nobel Prize winner) Friedrich August von Hayek. He was a strong proponent of political (as well as economic) liberalism and defended his views in many works in the years after the Second World War. In my thesis, I analyzed Hayek's work focusing on the idea of «order» and «spontaneous evolution», his theory of Law, and finally, his constitutional proposal. I also compared his political work with some developments in Liberal and Libertarian political thought. Again, the work is in Italian, but if you are interested, take a look [here](/files/TESIMagistrale.pdf).

## My Ph.D. dissertation

For my Ph.D. dissertation, I worked on the history of how game theory entered into the toolbox of Political Scientists in a way (perhaps surprisingly) different from what it did in Economics. The «main character» of this story is the American political scientist William H. Riker, whose work and especially scholarship paved the way for the establishment of the so-called «Positive Political Theory». From this work, a paper is about to be published, and one working paper is currently under revision. You can find the abstract [here](https://hdl.handle.net/2158/1288364).
