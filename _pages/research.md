On this page, I upload some products of my research. These are my three dissertations and some notes (about Economics, especially Micro, but others can arrive hopefully).

## My Bachelor's dissertation

I obtained my Bachelor's in History with a dissertation on Pietro Verri, an enlightenment Milanese intellectual. In 1771 Verri published a brief work about Political Economy, titled «Le Meditazioni sull'Economia Politica». In my dissertation, I analyzed the content of this work, also embedding it in the development of European Economic Thought in the XVIIIth century. This work is in Italian, but if you are interested (and understand Italian), you can read it [here](/files/TesiTriennale2016.pdf).

## My Master of Arts dissertation

I earned my Master of Arts in History and Civilization at the University of Pisa. There I worked mainly on the political theory of the renowned economist (and Economics Nobel Prize winner) Friedrich August von Hayek. He was a strong proponent of political (as well as economic) liberalism and defended his views in many works in the years after the Second World War. In my thesis, I analyzed Hayek's work focusing on the idea of «order» and «spontaneous evolution», his theory of Law, and finally, his constitutional proposal. I also compared his political work with some developments in Liberal and Libertarian political thought. Again, the work is in Italian, but if you are interested, take a look [here](/files/TESIMagistrale.pdf).

## My Ph.D. dissertation

For my Ph.D. dissertation, I worked on the history of how game theory entered into the toolbox of Political Scientists in a way (perhaps surprisingly) different from what it did in Economics. The «main character» of this story is the American political scientist William H. Riker, whose work and especially scholarship paved the way for the establishment of the so-called «Positive Political Theory». From this work, a paper is about to be published, and one working paper is currently under revision. You can find the abstract [here](https://hdl.handle.net/2158/1288364). 

Also, you can [download it here](/files/DissertationDAMIANI.pdf)

## Class notes on Microeconomics

If you are interested in Microeconomics or want to refresh some ideas, the following notes I took can be useful. Please notice, anyway, that these are far from being complete and are a work in progress (and there can be some typos...)

On Classical Demand Theory (Marshallian and Hicksian Demand, Slutsky Equation, and so on), you can take a look [here](/files/NotesClassicalDemandTheory.pdf). These notes are mainly based on the third chapter of [Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green](https://www.amazon.it/Microeconomic-Theory-Andreu-Mas-Colell/dp/0195102681)(of course!)(from now on, MWG) and chapters eight, nine and ten of [Varian](https://www.amazon.com/Microeconomic-Analysis-Third-Hal-Varian/dp/0393957357).

On Production Theory, you can take a look at these brief [notes](/files/NotesProductionTheory.pdf), based on chapter five of MWG. 

An overview of General Economic Equilibrium is [here](/files/NotesGeneralEconomicEquilibrium.pdf). This contains the Welfare Theorems (First and Second) and their proofs, as well as the statement and the proof (simplified) of the Existence Theorem for General Economic Equilibrium (AKA Arrow-Debreu Theorem).

Last (but not least!), [here](/files/NotesGameTheory.pdf) is a graduate introduction to Game Theory, based on the course I took at the Master in Economics at the Collegio Carlo Alberto (taught by [Dino Gerardi](https://sites.google.com/carloalberto.org/dinogerardi/)).

A set of exercises solved on Micro (but not Game Theory) is [here](/files/ExercisesMicro.pdf).
