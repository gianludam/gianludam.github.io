On this page, I will upload some material I am working on (especially Class Notes on Economics I took, Exercises solved, and so on). Therefore, the following can be useful if you are interested in Econ or want to refresh some ideas. Please notice, anyway, that these are far from being complete and are a work in progress (and there can be some typos, but I try to amend them...)

## Class notes on Microeconomics

On Microeconomics (Rational Choice, Classical Demand Theory, General Equilibrium in a Pure Exchange Economy), you can take a look [here](/files/NotesClassicalDemandTheory.pdf). These notes are mainly based on the third chapter of [Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green](https://www.amazon.it/Microeconomic-Theory-Andreu-Mas-Colell/dp/0195102681) (of course!)(from now on, MWG) and chapters eight, nine and ten of [Varian](https://www.amazon.com/Microeconomic-Analysis-Third-Hal-Varian/dp/0393957357).

On Production Theory, you can take a look at these brief [notes](/files/NotesProductionTheory.pdf), based on chapter five of MWG. 

An overview of General Economic Equilibrium is [here](/files/NotesGeneralEconomicEquilibrium.pdf). This contains the Welfare Theorems (First and Second) and their proofs, as well as the statement and the proof (simplified) of the Existence Theorem for General Economic Equilibrium (AKA Arrow-Debreu Theorem).

Last (but not least!), [here](/files/NotesGameTheory.pdf) is a graduate introduction to Game Theory, the notes I took from the course in the Master in Economics at the Collegio Carlo Alberto (taught by [Dino Gerardi](https://sites.google.com/carloalberto.org/dinogerardi/)).

A set of exercises solved on Micro (but not Game Theory) is [here](/files/ExercisesMicro.pdf).
