On this page, I will upload some material I am working on (especially Class Notes on Economics I took, Exercises solved, and so on). Therefore, the following can be useful if you are interested in Econ or want to refresh some ideas. Please notice, anyway, that these are far from being complete and are a work in progress (and there can be some typos, but I try to amend them...)

## Class notes on Microeconomics

First, for a refresher on math, [here](/files/MathEcon.pdf). There are some notes with some useful material (especially Optimization theory). 

On Microeconomics (Rational Choice, Classical Demand Theory, General Equilibrium in a Pure Exchange Economy), you can take a look [here](/files/NotesMicroeconomics.pdf). These notes are mainly based on the lectures I attended and some useful material from [Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green](https://www.amazon.it/Microeconomic-Theory-Andreu-Mas-Colell/dp/0195102681) (of course!) and [Varian](https://www.amazon.com/Microeconomic-Analysis-Third-Hal-Varian/dp/0393957357).

Last (but not least), [here](files/NotesGT.pdf) is a graduate introduction to Game Theory, the notes I took from the course in the Master in Economics at the Collegio Carlo Alberto.

Finally, an example of my early fascination with Intellectual history and the history of Economic Thought: some notes I wrote about some aspects of the late XIXth century Marginal Revolution and the early attempts to employ mathematics in Economics. You can read it [here](
