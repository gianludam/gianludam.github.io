I am an Italian scholar with a fairly heterogeneous background. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Previously I obtained a Bachelor of Arts (2016) and a Master of Art (2018) in History (respectively at the University of Milan and the University of Pisa) and a Ph.D. (2022) in Social and Political Sciences (in a program called “Social and Political Change,” co-hosted by the Universities of Florence and Turin).

In the first part of my academic career, my main interest was Intellectual History (especially the History of Political Thought and Political Economy) and Political Philosophy. I worked on Pietro Verri, a Milanese intellectual of the XVIIIth century, F.A. Hayek, the outstanding economist and political philosopher, and on the History of Mathematical Economics and Game Theory.
The topic of my Ph.D. Dissertation was the entry of Game Theory into the toolbox of Political Scientists, focusing especially on the role of William H. Riker. However, working on that, the focus of my interests shifted from Intellectual History to Economics.
Therefore, after having completed a Master of Arts in Economics (2023) at the Collegio Carlo Alberto in Turin, I am now enrolled in the Ph.D. Program in Economics at UNC.

My non-academic interests include Military History (especially the Napoleonic War, American Civil War, and First World War), Byzantine History, and History of Mathematics. Further, I am an avid supporter of Juventus Football Club.
