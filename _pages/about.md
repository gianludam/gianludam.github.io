Hello. Welcome to my personal website! 

I come from Northern Italy. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Previously I earned a Bachelor of Arts (2016) and a Master of Art (2018) in History (respectively at the University of Milan and the University of Pisa) and a Ph.D. (2022) in Social and Political Sciences (in a program called [“Social and Political Change”](https://www.mutamentosocialepolitico.unifi.it/) co-hosted by the Universities of Florence and Turin).

During my [Ph.D. research](/pages/research.md), I worked mainly on the history of Mathematical Economics and Game Theory and spent a period as a [visiting fellow](https://hope.econ.duke.edu/node/1830) at the Center for the History of Political Economy at Duke University. This shifted the focus of my interests from Intellectual History to Economics (even if, needless to say, the earlier has not completely disappeared). 

Therefore, after having completed a Master of Arts in Economics (2023) at the [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/education/master-in-economics/) in Turin, I am now enrolled in the Ph.D. Program in Economics at UNC.

As a scholar with broad training in humanities and politics, I am mainly interested in political institutions, individual behavior, and their interactions using the tools of modern economics.

My non-academic interests include Military History (especially the Napoleonic Wars, the American Civil War, and the First World War), Byzantine History, and (to a lesser degree) the History of Mathematics and Science. Further, I am an avid reader and books collector and a supporter of Juventus Football Club.
