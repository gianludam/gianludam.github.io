Hello. Welcome to my personal page! 

I come from Northern Italy. I hold a Ph.D. in Social and Political Sciences (in a program called [“Social and Political Change”](https://www.mutamentosocialepolitico.unifi.it/) co-hosted by the Universities of Florence and Turin). I earned a Bachelor of Arts (2016) and a Master of Art (2018) in History (respectively at the University of Milan and the University of Pisa), and a Master in Economics (2023) at the Collegio Carlo Alberto and a Master of Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

During my [Ph.D. research](https://gianludam.github.io/research/), I worked mainly on the history of Mathematical Economics and Game Theory, and I spent a period as a [visiting fellow](https://hope.econ.duke.edu/node/1830) at the Center for the History of Political Economy at Duke University.  

My non-academic interests include the history of the War of American Independence, especially the British side, the Napoleonic Wars, the American Civil War, and the First World War, Roman History (especially late antiquity and Byzantines - wrong name, I know), and (to a lesser degree) the History of Science. Further, I am an avid reader and books collector and a supporter of Juventus Football Club.
