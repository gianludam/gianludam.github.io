Norberto Bobbio occupies a central place in the history of Italian Political Science in the second Postwar, primarily in the debates about the proper role of political science in general political studies, which in Italy, up to the 1960s, comprised only the philosophy of law, history, and constitutional law. In doing this, Bobbio was deeply influenced by Italian ‘elitist’ authors Gaetano Mosca and Vilfredo Pareto. This paper aims to discuss Bobbio’s role in these debates and his analysis of the relationship between ‘science and ideology,’ derived from Pareto’s sociology.
