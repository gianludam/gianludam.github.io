This is a working paper I presented at the 49th annual meeting of the History of Economics Society in December 2021 (Online).

## Abstract

The aim of this paper is twofold. First, to present a historical narrative of how political scientist William H. Riker, and renowned mathematical economist Lionel W. McKenzie, established political science and economics departments at the University of Rochester in the 1960s. Thanks to their efforts, Rochester evolved from a minor regional University to a leading U.S. research institution in economics and political science. Riker transformed American political science, establishing a theory-driven, formal approach labeled "Positive Political Theory" centered around game theory and rational choice. In this process, the closeness with McKenzie's economics certainly influenced Riker's ability to expand his theoretical agenda. Second, I try to show that the nature of this influence is more complicated than often stated since Riker did not limit himself to importing economic analysis into political science but was pursuing a theoretical and methodological agenda on his own.
